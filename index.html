		<h2>The History of Surfing</h2>
		<p>For centuries, surfing was a central part of ancient <strong>Polynesian</strong> culture. 
		   Surfing may have first been observed by Europeans in Tahiti in 1767 by 
		   <strong>Samuel Wallis</strong> and the crew members of the <em>Dolphin</em> who were the first 
		   Europeans to visit the island in June of that year. Another candidate is
		   the botanist <strong>Joseph Banks</strong> being part of the first voyage of <strong> 
		   James Cook</strong> on the <em>HMS Endeavour</em>, who arrived in Tahiti on 10 April 1769. <strong>Lieutenant
		   James King</strong> was the first person to write about the art of surfing in Hawaii 
		   when he was completing the journals of <strong>Captain James Cook</strong> upon Cook's death
		   in 1779.</p>
		   
		   <p>When <strong>Mark Twain</strong> visited Hawaii in 1866 he wrote, <q>In one place we came 
		   upon a large company of naked natives, of both sexes and all ages, amusing 
		   themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing.</q></p>
